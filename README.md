# Chicago-Data-Portal-analyze-using-SQL-queries

This is the Final-project of Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python Course - IBM Data Engineering PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE on Coursera.

We will be working on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. Imagine, We are have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. You will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.
